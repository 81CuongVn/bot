class PersistentScheduler:
    """
    Schedule the execution of coroutines and keep track of them even across restarts and cog reloads.

    When instantiating a PersistentScheduler, a name must be provided. This name is used to distinguish the
    instance's log messages and RedisCache from other instances. Using the name of the class or module containing
    the instance is suggested. The same name must be provided after a restart for the tasks to be preserved.

    A coroutine must be provided in order to reschedule each of the keys contained in the cache at init.
    The coroutine will take a single argument -- the ID that was used to create the Scheduler task in the first place.

    Coroutines can be scheduled with `schedule_at` or `schedule_later`.
    A unique ID is required to be given in order to keep track of the resulting Tasks.
    Any scheduled task can be cancelled prematurely using `cancel` by providing the same ID used to schedule it, but
    the task will be rescheduled from the cache on the next initialization. To remove the task completely, you can
    `delete` it.
    The `in` operator is supported for checking if a task with a given ID is currently scheduled.

    Any exception raised in a scheduled task is logged when the task is done.
